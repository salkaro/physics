## What are Waves?

Waves are disturbances that propagate through space and matter, transferring energy without transferring matter.

They extend the concept of oscillations to include spatial propagation.

Key concepts include wavelength, frequency, amplitude, superposition, and interference.

## Why Study Waves?

They explain how sound travels, how light behaves, and how earthquakes propagate through Earth.

They are fundamental to acoustics, optics, telecommunications, and quantum mechanics.

## Applications

- Sound engineering and music
- Radio and wireless communications
- Earthquake analysis and seismology
- Medical ultrasound imaging

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of oscillatory motion
- Trigonometry and basic calculus
- Vector mathematics
- Energy and momentum conservation

## Module Breakdown
