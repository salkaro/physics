# Waves

Waves are disturbances that transfer energy through space and matter without transferring the matter itself.

This module explores the mathematical description of waves, superposition principles, sound waves, and the wave properties of light.

Understanding wave behavior is crucial for applications ranging from acoustics to optics and modern physics.
