## What is Gravitation?

Gravitation studies the force of attraction between all masses in the universe.

It extends Newton's laws to explain planetary motion, orbits, and gravitational fields.

Key concepts include gravitational force, field strength, potential, and orbital mechanics.

## Why Study Gravitation?

It explains why objects fall, how planets orbit the Sun, and how satellites stay in space.

It is fundamental to astronomy, aerospace engineering, and cosmology.

## Applications

- Satellite orbit design and GPS systems
- Space mission planning and trajectory calculations
- Understanding tides and planetary motion
- Astrophysics and black hole physics

## Prerequisites

- Newton's laws of motion
- Energy and work concepts
- Vector mathematics
- Circular motion and centripetal force

## Module Breakdown
- **2. Gravitational Field Strength**: The gravitational field as force per unit mass
- **3. Acceleration Due to Gravity**: Variation of g with altitude and depth
- **4. Gravitational Potential**: Energy per unit mass in a gravitational field
- **5. Escape Velocity**: Minimum speed needed to escape a gravitational field
- **6. Circular Orbits**: Analysis of satellites and planets in circular motion
- **7. Kepler's First Law**: Planetary orbits are ellipses with the sun at one focus
- **8. Kepler's Second Law**: Equal areas swept out in equal times (conservation of angular momentum)
- **9. Kepler's Third Law**: Relationship between orbital period and semi-major axis
- **10. Spherical Shell**: Gravitational field inside and outside spherical mass distributions
- **11. Dark Stars and Black Holes**: Extreme gravitational effects and event horizons
