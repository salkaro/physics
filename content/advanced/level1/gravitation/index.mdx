# Gravitation

Gravitation is one of the four fundamental forces of nature, governing the attraction between masses. 

This topic explores Newton's law of universal gravitation, gravitational fields and potentials, orbital motion, and Kepler's laws of planetary motion.
 
From understanding how objects fall on Earth to predicting the motion of planets and satellites, gravitation provides the framework for analyzing motion under gravitational influence.
