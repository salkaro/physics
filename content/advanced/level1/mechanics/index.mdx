# Mechanics

Classical mechanics forms the foundation of physics, describing the motion of objects and the forces that cause that motion.

This module introduces essential concepts including vector operations, equations of motion, friction, energy, and momentum.

These principles are fundamental to understanding more advanced topics in physics and engineering.
