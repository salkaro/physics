## What is Classical Mechanics?

Classical mechanics studies how objects move and how forces cause that motion.

It is the foundation of all physics, describing motion from everyday objects to planets.

Key concepts include vectors, forces, energy, momentum, and Newton's laws.

## Why Study Classical Mechanics?

It explains how vehicles accelerate, how projectiles fly, and how collisions occur.

It is fundamental to engineering, robotics, aerospace, and all physical sciences.

## Applications

- Vehicle dynamics and transportation
- Structural engineering and construction
- Sports science and biomechanics
- Space mission trajectories

## Prerequisites

- Basic algebra and trigonometry
- Understanding of position, velocity, and acceleration
- Vector notation

## Module Breakdown
