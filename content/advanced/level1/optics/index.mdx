# Optics

Optics is the study of light and its interactions with matter, encompassing both geometric and wave descriptions of light behavior.

This module covers refraction, reflection, total internal reflection, fiber optics, interference, and diffraction phenomena.

Understanding optics is fundamental to technologies including lenses, optical fibers, lasers, and modern imaging systems.
