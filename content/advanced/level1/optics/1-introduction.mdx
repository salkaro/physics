## What is Optics?

Optics studies the behavior of light and its interactions with matter.

It encompasses both geometric optics (ray-based) and wave optics (interference and diffraction).

Key concepts include refraction, reflection, interference patterns, and diffraction effects.

## Why Study Optics?

It explains how lenses focus light, how rainbows form, and how fiber optics transmit data.

It is fundamental to fields like photography, telecommunications, astronomy, and vision science.

## Applications

- Cameras and telescopes
- Fiber optic communications
- Laser technology
- Medical imaging and microscopy

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of waves
- Trigonometry
- Light as an electromagnetic wave

## Module Breakdown
- **Snells Law**: Refraction at interfaces, relationship between angles and refractive indices
- **Total Internal Reflection**: Critical angle, applications in prisms and optical fibers
- **Fibre Optics**: Light propagation in optical fibers, applications in communications
- **Geometric Optics**: Ray diagrams, thin lens equation, mirrors
- **Double Slit Interference**: Young's experiment, interference pattern calculation
- **Diffraction**: Single-slit diffraction, diffraction limits
