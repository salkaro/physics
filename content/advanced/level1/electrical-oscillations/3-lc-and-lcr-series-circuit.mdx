## Definitions

**LC Series Circuit**

- An inductor and capacitor are connected in Series

- No resistance

**LCR Series Circuit**

- An inductor, capacitor and resistor are connected in Series

**Instananeous Charge $q$**

- The charge on the capacitor at any given time during the oscillation.

**Phase Constant $\phi$**

- Sets where in the oscillation the system starts

If the capacitor is charged, then put in series with the inductor

$$
\sum V = V_L + V_C = 0
$$

subbing in $V_L$ and $V_C$

$$
L\dfrac{di}{dt} + \dfrac{q}{C} = 0
$$

since $i = \dfrac{dq}{dt}$

$$
\dfrac{d^2q}{dt^2} + \dfrac{1}{LC}q = 0
$$

this takes the form of SMH so 

$$
\omega = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}, \quad T = 2\pi \sqrt{LC}
$$

we can now form a wave equation for this

$$
q = Qcos(wt + \phi)
$$

where $Q$ is the maxium charge on the capacitor
