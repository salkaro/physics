Moment of Inertia depends on the distribution of mass around the fixed axis of rotation

$$
I = \sum_i m_i r_i^2
$$

where $r$ is the distance to the axis

## Kinetic Energy

$$
K = \dfrac{1}{2}mv^2 = \dfrac{1}{2}m\omega^2r^2
$$

we will assume $\omega$ is constant

$$
K_{\text{total}} = \sum_{i} \dfrac{1}{2}m_i r_{i}^2 \omega_{i}^2 = \dfrac{1}{2} I \omega^2 
$$

$$
\boxed{K_{\text{total}} = \dfrac{1}{2} I \omega^2}
$$

## Calculating Moment of Inertia

### Discrete vs Continuous

For a system of **point masses**:

$$
I = \sum_i m_i r_i^2
$$

For a **continuous body**, divide it into small elements $(dm)$:

$$
I = \int r^2 \, \; dm
$$

### 3D Bodies

Express \(dm\) in terms of **density** $(\rho)$ and **volume element** $(dV)$:

$$
dm = \rho \, dV
$$

then the moment of inertia becomes:

$$
I = \int r^2 \, \; dm = \int r^2 \rho \, \; dV
$$

we choose $(dV)$ such that all points in the element are approximately the **same distance $(r)$ from the axis**.
