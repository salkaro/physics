## Definitions
#### Angular Velocity (ω)

- Rate of change of angular displacement, measured in rad/s

#### Centripetal Acceleration

- Acceleration directed toward the center of circular motion, $a = \frac{v^2}{r}$

#### Centripetal Force

- Net force directed toward the center that keeps an object in circular motion, $F = \frac{mv^2}{r}$

## Derivations

starting with arc length and linear displacement

$$
s = \Delta \theta r
$$

$$
s = v \Delta t
$$

equating these expressions

$$
v \Delta t = \Delta \theta r
$$

rearranging

$$
\dfrac{v}{r} = \dfrac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t}
$$

by definition, angular velocity is the rate of change of angular displacement

$$
\omega = \dfrac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t}
$$

taking the limit as $\Delta t \to 0$

$$
\omega = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \dfrac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t} = \dfrac{d\theta}{dt}
$$

therefore, the relationship between linear and angular velocity is

$$
v = \omega r
$$

&nbsp;

## Useful Equations

$$
\omega = \frac{\theta}{t}, \quad s = \theta r, \quad v = \omega r
$$

$$
a = \frac{v^2}{r} = \omega^2 r
$$

$$
F = \frac{mv^2}{r} = m\omega^2 r
$$

### Example 1

A particle moves in a circle of radius 2 m with angular velocity 3 rad/s. What is its linear velocity?

#### Answer

Using $v = \omega r$

$$
v = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ m/s}
$$

&nbsp;

### Example 2

A car travels around a circular track of radius 50 m at 20 m/s. What centripetal acceleration does it experience?

#### Answer

Using $a = \frac{v^2}{r}$

$$
a = \frac{20^2}{50} = \frac{400}{50} = 8 \text{ m/s}^2
$$
