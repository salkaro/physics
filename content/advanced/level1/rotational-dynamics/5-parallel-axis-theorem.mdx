## Definitions
#### Parallel Axis Theorem

- A theorem that relates the moment of inertia about any axis to the moment of inertia about a parallel axis through the center of mass

$$
I_p = I_{cm} + Md^2
$$

where $I_p$ is the moment of inertia around the rotation axis, $I_{cm}$ is the moment of inertia around the centre of mass, $M$ is the total mass, and $d$ is the distance between the two parallel axes

&nbsp;

## Derivations

objects don't always rotate around the most convenient axis

the parallel axis theorem states that

$$
I_p = I_{cm} + Md^2
$$

where $I_p$ is the moment of inertia about a parallel axis at distance $d$ from the center of mass

this allows us to calculate the moment of inertia about any parallel axis if we know the moment of inertia about the center of mass

&nbsp;

## Useful Equations

$$
I_p = I_{cm} + Md^2
$$

&nbsp;

### Example 1

A slender rod of mass $M$ and length $L$ rotates about an axis through one end. Given that $I_{cm} = \frac{1}{12}ML^2$, what is the moment of inertia about the end?

#### Answer

Using the parallel axis theorem with $d = \frac{L}{2}$

$$
I_p = I_{cm} + Md^2
$$

$$
I_p = \dfrac{1}{12}ML^2 + M\left(\dfrac{L}{2}\right)^2
$$

$$
I_p = \dfrac{1}{12}ML^2 + \dfrac{1}{4}ML^2
$$

$$
I_p = \dfrac{1}{3}ML^2
$$

### Example 2

A disc of mass 5 kg has a moment of inertia about its center of 0.5 kg⋅m². What is its moment of inertia about an axis parallel to the center axis but 0.2 m away?

#### Answer

Using $I_p = I_{cm} + Md^2$

$$
I_p = 0.5 + 5(0.2)^2
$$

$$
I_p = 0.5 + 5(0.04) = 0.5 + 0.2 = 0.7 \text{ kg⋅m}^2
$$
