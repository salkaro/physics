title: 5. Parallel Axis Theorem
description: -----
---

Objects don't always rotate around the most convenient axis

The theorem states that

$$
I_p = I_{cm} + Md^2
$$

where

$I_p$ is the moment of inertia around the rotation axis, 

$I_{cm}$ is the moment of inertia around the centre of mass 

### Example

Rotation around the end of a slender rod

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img
    src="/advanced/level1/rotational-dynamics/parallel-axis-theorem.jpg"
    alt="Circular Motion"
    width={400}
    style={{borderRadius: 5}}
  />
</div>

using the Parallel Axis Theorem

$$
I_p = \dfrac{1}{12}ML^2 + M(\dfrac{L}{2})^2
$$

&nbsp;

$$
I_p = \dfrac{1}{3}ML^2
$$
