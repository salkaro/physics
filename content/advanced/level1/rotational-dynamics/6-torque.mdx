Measure of rotational force applied to an object that causes it to rotate around an axis

$$
\vec{\tau} = \vec{r} \times \vec{F} \quad (Nm)
$$

Consider a force ($\vec{F}$) acting on a particle (mass $m$, distance from axis $r$) that causes it to accelerate around an axis

$$
\vec{F} = ma_t
$$

since 

$$
a_t = \alpha r
$$

then

$$
\vec{F} = m r \alpha
$$

multiply both sides by $r$

$$
\vec{F}r = m r^2 \alpha
$$

then

$$
\vec{\tau} = I \alpha
$$
