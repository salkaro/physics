## What is Rotational Dynamics?

Rotational dynamics studies the motion of objects rotating about an axis or moving in circular paths.

It extends linear dynamics to rotational motion, creating analogs for all linear quantities.

Key parallels include force → torque, mass → moment of inertia, and linear momentum → angular momentum.

## Why Study Rotational Dynamics?

It explains how wheels spin, how planets orbit, and how figure skaters control their rotation speed.

It is fundamental to mechanical engineering, robotics, aerospace, and astrophysics.

## Applications

- Rotating machinery and turbines
- Gyroscopes and navigation systems
- Planetary and satellite motion
- Sports biomechanics (diving, skating, gymnastics)

## Prerequisites

- Linear kinematics and dynamics
- Newton's laws of motion
- Vector mathematics and cross products
- Energy and momentum conservation

## Module Breakdown
- **Circular Motion**: Description of uniform and non-uniform motion in circles, relating linear and angular quantities
- **Angular Acceleration**: How rotational speed changes over time and its relationship to tangential acceleration
- **Moment of Inertia**: The rotational analog of mass, determining an object's resistance to rotational acceleration
- **Parallel Axis Theorem**: A method for calculating moments of inertia about different axes
- **Torque**: The rotational analog of force, causing angular acceleration
- **Angular Momentum**: The rotational analog of linear momentum and its conservation in isolated systems
