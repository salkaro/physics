Measure of the amount of rotational motion an object has about a particular axis

## Rotating Rigid Body

$$
\vec{L} = \vec{r} \times \vec{\rho}
$$

$$
\vec{L} = \vec{r} \times (m \vec{v}) = m \times \vec{v}^2
$$

For a rotating rigid body, the total momentum is given by

$$
\vec{L} = I \omega
$$

&nbsp;

## Rate of Change of Angular Momentum

The rate of change of angular momentum is equal to the net torque

$$
\dfrac{d\vec{L}}{dt} = \dfrac{d\vec{r}}{dt} \vec{\rho} + \vec{r}\dfrac{d\vec{\rho}}{dt}
$$

assuming $\vec{r}$ is constant and we know $\dfrac{d\vec{\rho}}{dt} = \vec{F}$ from linear rate of change of momentum

then

$$
\dfrac{d\vec{L}}{dt} = \vec{r} \times \vec{F} = \vec{\tau}
$$

&nbsp;

## Conservation of Angular Momentum

When the net external torque acting on a system is zero, the total angular momentum of the system is constant

if 

$$
\sum \vec{\tau} = 0
$$

then 

$$
\dfrac{d\vec{L}}{dt} = 0
$$

and

$$
\vec{L} = \text{constant}
$$
