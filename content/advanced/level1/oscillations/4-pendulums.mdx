## Definitions

**Torsional Pendulum**

- A system twisted by a small angular displacement $\theta$ due to torque

**Simple Pendulum**

- A system consisting of a point mass suspended by a rod or string of negligible mass

## Derivations

### Torsional Pendulum

We define

$$
\tau_z = -k\theta
$$

where $k$ is the torsion constant

since 

$$
\tau_z = I\alpha_z = I\ddot{\theta}
$$

equating $\tau_z$

$$
\ddot{\theta} = -\dfrac{k}{I} \theta
$$

this is in the form of SMH therefore

$$
\omega^2 = \dfrac{k}{I}, \quad \omega = \sqrt{\dfrac{k}{I}}
$$

### Simple Pendulum

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <img
    src="/advanced/level1/oscillations/simple-pendulum.jpg"
    alt="Simple Pendulum"
    width={400}
    style={{ borderRadius: 5 }}
  />
</div>

We can see that 

$$
sin(\theta) = \dfrac{x}{L}
$$

where $\theta$ is in radians

assuming $\theta$ is small

$$
\theta \approx \dfrac{x}{L}
$$

therefore the restoring force is

$$
F \approx -mg \dfrac{x}{L}
$$

since $\dfrac{mg}{L}$ is constant we define $k$ as this constant such that

$$
F \approx -kx
$$

solving for $\omega$, we can divide both sides by $m$

$$
a = -\dfrac{k}{m}x
$$

thereforce

$$
\omega = \sqrt{\dfrac{k}{m}}
$$

subbing $k = \dfrac{mg}{L}$

$$
\omega = \sqrt{\dfrac{g}{L}}
$$

**Why don't we account for tension $T$**
- String doesn't change length
- Bob moves in a circular arc
- So tension is always perpendicular to displacement

$$
T \cdot s = 0
$$

where $s$ is the displacement along the path (arc length)

therefore no work done by tension
