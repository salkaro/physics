# Oscillations

Oscillatory motion is repetitive motion about an equilibrium position, found throughout nature from atomic vibrations to planetary orbits.

This module focuses on simple harmonic motion, energy in oscillating systems, pendulums, and the effects of damping and external forcing.

Mastering oscillations is essential for understanding resonance, wave phenomena, and many real-world mechanical and electrical systems.
