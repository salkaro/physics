#### Angular Velocity

Restoring force

$$
\tau = -mgdsin(\theta)
$$

for small angles

$$
sin(\theta) = \theta
$$

therefore

$$
\tau = -mgd\theta, \quad \tau = I\ddot{\theta}
$$

so 

$$
I\ddot{\theta} + mgd\theta = 0
$$

rewritten we get

$$
\ddot{\theta} = -\dfrac{mgd}{I}\theta
$$

this is in the form of a SHM therefore

$$
\omega^2 = \dfrac{mgd}{I}
$$

#### Kinetic Energy

Since 

$$
v = \omega r, \quad dK = \dfrac{1}{2}v^2 \; dm
$$

we can write the kinetic energy as

$$
dK = \dfrac{1}{2}r^2\omega^2 \; dm
$$

integrate both sides

$$
K = \dfrac{1}{2}\omega \int{r^2 \; dm} = \dfrac{1}{2}I\omega^2
$$

## Useful Equations

&nbsp;

### Example 1

A physical pendulum consists of a thin, uniform rod of length $L$. The rod is pivoted at one end and undergoes small oscillations.

Calculate the period of oscillation.

#### Answer

Moment of inertia of a rod

$$
I = \dfrac{1}{3}mL^2
$$

equation for period

$$
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\dfrac{I}{mgd}}
$$

$d$ is the distance to the centre of mass so

$$
d = \dfrac{1}{2}L
$$

subbing $I$ and $d$ into the equation for the period

$$
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\dfrac{\dfrac{1}{3}mL^2}{mg \dfrac{1}{2}L}}
$$

simplify

$$
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\dfrac{2}{3} \dfrac{L}{g}}
$$

### Example 2
A physical pendulum consists of a thin, uniform rod of length $L$ and mass $m$, pivoted at one end. At a given instant, the rod has angular speed ($\omega$)

Calculate the kinetic energy of the rod.

#### Answer

Moment of inertia for a uniform rod

$$
I = \dfrac{1}{3}mL^2
$$

sub $I$ into kinetic energy equation

$$
K = \dfrac{1}{2}(\dfrac{1}{3}mL^2)\omega^2
$$

therefore

$$
K = \dfrac{1}{6}mL^2\omega^2
$$
