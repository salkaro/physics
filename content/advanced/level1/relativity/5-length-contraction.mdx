## Definitions

#### Proper Length
- $l_0$ is the proper length or the length of the stationary observer

#### Observer at constant $v$
- $l$ is the length measured in the frame of the observer

&nbsp;

## Derivations

Consider a rod at rest in frame $S'$

its endpoints have fixed coordinates

$$
x_1' = 0, \quad x_2' = l_0
$$

the proper length is measured at the same time in the rest frame

$$
l_0 = x_2' - x_1'
$$

now look at the same rod from frame $S$, where the rod moves with speed $v$

to measure length in $S$, you must record the positions of both ends simultaneously in $S$

$$
t_1 = t_2
$$

the measured length is

$$
l = x_2 - x_1
$$

use the Lorentz transformation for space

$$
x' = \gamma(x - vt)
$$

apply this to each endpoint

$$
x_2' - x_1' = \gamma[(x_2 - vt_2) - (x_1 - vt_1)]
$$

since the measurement in $S$ is simultaneous, $t_1 = t_2$, so the time terms cancel

$$
x_2' - x_1' = \gamma(x_2 - x_1)
$$

identify the lengths

$$
l_0 = \gamma l
$$

rearranging

$$
l = \frac{l_0}{\gamma}
$$

since $\gamma > 1$, then $l < l_0$

therefore the length measured by the moving observer is contracted

## Useful Equations

$$
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}, \quad l = \frac{l_0}{\gamma}
$$
