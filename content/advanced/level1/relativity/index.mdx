# Relativity

Special relativity revolutionized our understanding of space and time, showing that they are interconnected and relative to the observer's frame of reference.

This module explores the consequences of Einstein's postulates, including time dilation, length contraction, and the equivalence of mass and energy.

These concepts are essential for understanding high-speed phenomena and modern physics.
