## What is Special Relativity?

Special relativity studies how space and time are interconnected and relative to the observer's frame of reference.

It extends classical mechanics to objects moving at speeds comparable to the speed of light.

Key concepts include time dilation (moving clocks run slower) and length contraction (moving objects appear shorter).

## Why Study Special Relativity?

It explains why nothing can travel faster than light and how particle accelerators work.

It is fundamental to modern physics, particle physics, and cosmology.

## Applications

- Particle physics and accelerators
- GPS satellite timing corrections
- Nuclear energy and E=mc²
- Understanding cosmic ray behavior

## Prerequisites

- Classical mechanics
- Basic algebra and trigonometry
- Understanding of inertial reference frames

## Module Breakdown
- **Time Dialation**: Moving clocks run slower, calculation using Lorentz factor γ
- **Muon Decay**: Experimental evidence for time dilation from cosmic ray muons
- **Length Contraction**: Moving objects appear contracted along direction of motion
- **Mass and Energy**: Mass-energy equivalence, rest mass energy, relativistic kinetic energy
